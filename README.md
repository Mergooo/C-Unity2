little rpg based on a beginner c#unity course from udemy



GAMEFLOW:

    after start, one enemy will spawn and player can attack it, with approaching him and clicking left mouse
    with each hit on enemy, enemies hp decreases and vice versa
    if players hp drops to 0, game will start again
    if enemies hp drops to zero, it will be destroyed, drops one health portion and game is finished
    game has save function to save stats of player


PLAYER STATS:

    -hp
    -stamina
    -attackPower

    -attack power



game is basically the game from the course. I added...

    - that enemy drops stamina portion when player hits enemy
    - that back to title button appears, when enemy is defeated
